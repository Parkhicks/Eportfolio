      <h3>Academic Achievements</h3>
      <p>
        Thus far I feel I've excelled in my academic career. I started in 5th grade by being placed into a group of 5 other students who learned advanced math, this continued as in High school I took mainly AP courses or Dual credit with Salt lake Community College. While going through High School I got the vision of graduating from high school with my associates degree for the next three years I worked hard towards this goal. In June of 2019 I was able to Graduate from Salt Lake Community College with an associates degree. One month later I was able to graduate from Bingham High School. I'm continuing this trend and am currently studying for a minor as well as my bachelors. My current GPA is 3.5. I've been involved in a number of extra cirriculars including band and marching band, and now NAHB.

      <h3>Professional Career</h3>
      <p>
        I have developed an incredible work ethic through various different jobs. I started working when I was 14, worked through high school and up until my mission then returned to work right when I got home. I started with the Jordan School District as a janitor and was there for two years. I then got hired on as a lifeguard and swim instructor for Goldfish Swim School where I taught different students various tecniques of swimming. When I got home from my mission I worked laying carpet and commercial flooring with Utah Contract Flooring, then while up at college worked at Battle Axe Construction, in the summer I went down to work in Southern California installing security systems for Vivint Smart Home.
