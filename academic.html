            <H1>Academic Achievements</H1>
            <H2>Thus far I feel I've excelled in my academic career. I started in 5th grade by being placed into a group of 5 other students who learned advanced math, this continued as in High school I took mainly AP courses or Dual credit with Salt lake Community College. While going through High School I got the vision of graduating from high school with my associates degree for the next three years I worked hard towards this goal. In June of 2019 I was able to Graduate from Salt Lake Community College with an associates degree. One month later I was able to graduate from Bingham High School. I'm continuing this trend and am currently studying for a minor as well as my bachelors. My current GPA is 3.5. I've been involved in a number of extra cirriculars including band and marching band, and now NAHB.</H2>
