        <H1>Professional Career</H1>
        <H2>I have developed an incredible work ethic through various different jobs. I started working when I was 14, worked through high school and up until my mission then returned to work right when I got home. I started with the Jordan School District as a janitor and was there for two years. I then got hired on as a lifeguard and swim instructor for Goldfish Swim School where I taught different students various tecniques of swimming. When I got home from my mission I worked laying carpet and commercial flooring with Utah Contract Flooring, then while up at college worked at Battle Axe Construction, in the summer I went down to work in Southern California installing security systems for Vivint Smart Home.</H2>
